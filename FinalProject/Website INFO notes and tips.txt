I have uploaded Rose's webpage with my info on GitHub.

I couldn't load the same background on my Matrix page which appears when you click Julie.  
It messed up the file layout and to keep from jumping off the roof I found a real turd of a work around

Click on the BOOM pick and it will take you to the bubbles page.  I tried to get both on one page but the MATRIX is a real pain.  

The Bubble page has the top border that can get you back to front page.

Things to do 

ALI - add your page to the ali.html file


NICK - add your page to the nick.html file

Either of you - The Summary button is a big off - as in you have to click next to it.  I tried to fix but couldn't get it to work.  

Not huge but if you have nothing better to do take a look.  My cell phone number is 314-503-4635 if you need help.

ALSO - the slide show (arrows midway through screen) doesn't really do anything.  We can leave them, just don't click on them.
